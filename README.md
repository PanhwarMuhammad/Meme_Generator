This is my first Project that I developed to learn about API.
I have used Kotlin as primary language and the API is of imgflip. The UI is clumsy because I only focused on logic.
It has two Endpoints, one is for fetching details of the memes available and the other one uses those details to fetch those Memes and then they are placed in RecyclerView.
